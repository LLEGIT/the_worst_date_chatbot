# Le pire date

A Discord chatbot game inspired by Squeezie (French YouTuber).

## Concept
"Le pire date" is a Discord bot that simulates a dating game. A random character (generated by AI) asks you 5 questions to get to know you. Your answers are evaluated:
- If you give a "bad" answer (red flag), you lose immediately (1 life only).
- If you give a "good" answer (green flag), you win the game!

## How it works
- The bot generates a random persona and asks you 5 questions.
- You answer each question in Discord.
- The bot uses AI to judge your answers and flags them as red or green.
- 2 red flags = game over. 1 green flag = you win!
